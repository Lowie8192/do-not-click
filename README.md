Welcome to my do-not-click project.

This project is originally made for trolling friends. I made this while i was in class so i had not much time to make this. (You can make it better, i accept Pull Requests.)
So, what the script does is actually just turning off the computer.


Logs:
* Change 1: Thanks SnowCode for leaving an issue, i accepted your pull request. Now it is a real crash script?
    * Okay, sorry Snow, but i just removed that.
* Change 2: I got a tip from LinuxMint4Ever, so i changed "shutdown -s" to "shutdown /h".
* Change 3: Today i fixed the echo's after the shutdown function. I Also updated the README. 

Thanks for using/reading this! For questions contact me on discord! More info on my site: https://Lowie8192.github.io/website/www/.
